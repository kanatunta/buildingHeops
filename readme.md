# [Pyramid](https://judge.telerikacademy.com/problem/21pyramids)  

### _Coki went to Egypt once. Since then he loves pyramids._
### _As all of us know, Coki also loves numbers..._
### _Sooooo, the expected result is that Coki wants to make pyramids of blocks with numbers!_
### _You have N blocks. With these blocks you should form pyramids._

### **Each pyramid is actually a right-angled, isosceles triangle with one cathetus on the surface (see example). Also, you can think of the triangle as a set of columns, where the leftmost is 1 and the rightmost is the highest. The Kth column has exactly K blocks on top one another.**
